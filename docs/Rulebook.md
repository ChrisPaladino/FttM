# Face to the Mat Game Rulebook

## **1. Game Overview**

*Face to the Mat* is a simulation-style tabletop wrestling game that recreates the drama and action of professional wrestling. Players control wrestlers in one-on-one, tag-team, and special match types, using Fast Action Cards (FACs), dice rolls, and wrestler stats to resolve action.

## **2. Game Components**

- Wrestler Cards (with stats and abilities)
- FAC Deck (Fast Action Cards)
- 2 six-sided dice (2d6; one black, one white for d66 resolution)
- Match Track (board or digital equivalent)
- Tokens for each wrestler (track progress)
- Score sheets
- Optional: Special boards (e.g. Out-of-Ring, Cage), Chart Books

## **3. Wrestler Attributes**

Each wrestler has:

### TV Grade

- Represents popularity.
- Grades: AAA > AA > A > B > C > D > E > F

### Grudge Grade

- Represents feud intensity. Can be positive or negative.

### Helped Wrestlers

- As promoter of yoru federation, you'll need to decide which of yoru wrestlers will get outside help in their rin adventures and what kind of help that will be. There are three kinds of help in Face to the Mat: gangs or groups (G); managers (M); or valets (V).

### Heels and Faces

- You will also want to decide which of your wrestlers are good guys (Faces) and bad guys (Heels). Generally speaking, wrestliers with the Favorite Skill are considered Faces, while those with the Cheat Skill are considered Heels. There are exepctions of course, and you should use discretion here.
- Some wrestlers will be niether Face or Heel. THey may defelop, or simply be an ambiguious character. For the purposes of the game, however, every match as a Face and Heel. If they are both Faces or Heels, then the wrester with the Higher Grudge Grade will be considered the Heel for this match.

- Move tokens based on point results

### End Conditions

## **6. Fast Action Cards (FACs)**

### FAC Types

- Skill-Specific
- TV Move
- Grudge
- Wild Card
- Highlight Reel
- Special Themed (e.g., REF BUMP)

### Resolution Process

1. Draw FAC  
2. Determine FAC type

  - There are five types of FACs: Skill-Specific; TV Move; Wild Card; Highlight Reel or Signature
  - A Skill-specific card calls for certain skills to come into play. If one of the wresters has that skill, then the wrestler scores the points indicated and moves forward. If Both wrestlers have the skill, then utilize the tie-breaker procedure laid out below. If neither wrestler has the skill then ignore the card and redraw.
  - If the FAC has In Control, then if a wrestler scored on the previous FAC, he is considered in control. If the In Control wrestler gets a Free Shot. If he has the skill on that card, they automatically score points. If they do not, then draw another card, and the opponent (not in control) gets a Free Shot. If they have the skill on taht card then they will automatically score points. If they do not have the skill, then it's a non-scoring card, and you should draw the next FAC.
