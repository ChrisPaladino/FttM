#### Implement
- Make the whole system a bit more manual
    - Allow moving of FAVORED / UNDERDOG pieces to specific places on the board
- Submission cards: moves break on 1-3 (1-4 if STRONG)
    - Confirm Submission works - why are we getting TV Grade?
- Pin in spaces 12-15
- Finisher in space 15, fail moves them back to space 9
- Editor doesn't seem to save
- Editor needs images
- Wild Card / Highlight reel cards
    - Need to distinguish which skills are mental vs. physical
- Test of Strength cards: results (if both STRONG and/or POWERFUL)
     - 1-2: Face scores 1 point
     - 3-4: Ref breaks hold
     - 5-6: Heel scores 1 point

    - Verify this works, our underdog is STRONG: Star, so I suspect she CAN use the card
Card drawn: Test of Strength (No Control)
Card type: Test of Strength
Favored can use: False
Underdog can use: False
Neither wrestler can use this skill. No points scored.



- HELP that makes you roll on the TYPE chart
    - G = gang/group
    - M = manager
    - V = valet
- Digitize the various charts
- Implement the Hot Box (Favored, Ally, Foe, High Grudge; Underdog, Ally, Foe, High Grudge)
- Ranking and pointing of wrestlers

#### Experiments
- In control should ONLY look at the last card, not look at the last scoring wrestler
    - I want to experiment with this rule - whoever last scored is in_control, not just the last card.
    - Note: Signature DOES still use the previous card
