Thank you for providing such detailed information about the Face to the Mat wrestling board game. To start creating a Python program for this game, we'll need to break it down into manageable components. Here's what I suggest we focus on initially:

1. Data Structures:
   - Create classes for Wrestlers, Cards, and the Game Board
   - Define the attributes for each class based on the information you've provided

2. Game Setup:
   - Initialize the game board
   - Create and shuffle the deck of cards
   - Select and place wrestlers in the Favored and Underdog positions
   - Set up the Ally, Foe, and High-Grudge wrestlers

3. Basic Game Loop:
   - Draw a card
   - Determine which wrestler can use the move
   - Apply the move's effects (moving along the track)
   - Check for pin attempts or finisher opportunities

4. Simple UI:
   - Create a text-based interface to display the game state and prompt for user input

To get started, I'd recommend focusing on these core elements. Once we have a basic working version, we can gradually add more complex rules and features.

Here's what I need from you to begin:

1. A list of all the wrestler attributes (Name, Weight, Height, Hometown, stats, finisher)
2. A sample of a few wrestler cards with their complete information
3. Confirmation on the total number of spaces on each side of the board (15 or 16, including the star/finisher spot)
4. Any specific rules for movement along the track or scoring that you want to implement first

With this information, we can start building the basic structure of the game in Python. We'll begin with creating the necessary classes and setting up the game board. After that, we can implement the core game loop and gradually add more features.
