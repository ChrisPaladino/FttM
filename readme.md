# 🥊 Face to the Mat v4

*A Python-based digital adaptation of the classic pro wrestling card game.*

## 🎮 Game Overview

**Face to the Mat** is a simulation-style wrestling game where players control wrestlers and experience dramatic matches and storylines through Fast Action Cards (FACs), dice rolls, and stat-based mechanics. This Python implementation brings the tabletop game to life — with match simulation, career tracking, and storyline progression.

## 🚀 Features

- 🧍 Wrestler creation, editing, and stat management
- 🃏 Card-based match resolution using a custom FAC deck
- 📺 Popularity and rivalry tracked via TV Grade and Grudge Grade
- 🎭 Match storytelling via Highlight Reels, Pre/Post match events
- 🤼‍♂️ Support for special match types: Grudge, Tag, Hardcore, etc.
- 🖥️ GUI support with optional Tkinter interface (in development)

## 🛠️ Installation

git clone <https://github.com/chrispaladino/face-to-the-mat.git>
cd face-to-the-mat
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/main.py

> Python 3.7+ required. Tkinter should be pre-installed, but if not:
> `sudo apt install python3-tk` (Linux) or `brew install python-tk` (Mac)

## 🧩 Game Rules & Flow

See [Markdown Rulebook](./docs/Rulebook_v4.md) for full gameplay mechanics.

### 🛎️ Core Concepts

- **Match Track**: 0–15 spaces, used to determine match progression
- **FAC Types**: Skill, TV Move, Grudge, Wild Card, Highlight Reel, Special
- **Skills**: 12 qualities each wrestler may have (AGILE, STRONG, etc.)
- **Symbols**: `★` Star (anytime), `■` Square (square spaces), `●` Circle (circle spaces)
- **Finishers**: Special roll-based moves that end matches if successful

## 🔁 Game Loop

1. **Setup** wrestlers and Hot Box (allies/foes)
2. **Pre-Match**: Optional Highlight Reel
3. **Draw FACs** → resolve actions, move tokens
4. **Check** for PIN or FINISHER
5. **Post-Match**: Optional story development

## 📝 Developer Notes

See [`docs/developmentroadmap.md`](./docs/developmentroadmap.md) for full backlog and rule integration status.

### Example: Remaining FAC Issues

{
  "id": 40,
  "type": "Helped",
  "text": "Go to HIGHLIGHT REEL 'G', 'M' or 'V' depending on the source of help."
}

- HELPED results may not trigger properly if no points are attached
- Highlight Reel routing system not fully digitized
- Need to distinguish mental vs. physical skills for certain cards
