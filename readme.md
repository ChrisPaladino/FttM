- In a tie breaker (both wrestlers have the skill, and they are on the same space) the points should go to the FAVORED wrestler unless the card is TRAILING, in which case tied position would go to the UNDERDOG wrestler.
- In control should ONLY look at the last card, not look at the last scoring wrestler
- TV cards should look at the score on the card and score than many points
- Highlight reel cards
- Submission cards: moves break on 1-3 (1-4 if STRONG)
- Test of Strength cards: results (if both STRONG and/or POWERFUL)
     - 1-2: Face scores 1 point
     - 3-4: Ref breaks hold
     - 5-6: Heel scores 1 point
- Pin in spaces 12-15
- Finisher in space 15, fail moves them back to space 9
